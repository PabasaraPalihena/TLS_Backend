//How to create an http server

//To generate a self-signed certificate, run the following in your shell:
openssl genrsa -out key.pem
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
rm csr.pem

/***This should leave you with two files, cert.pem (the certificate) and key.pem (the private key).
Put these files in the same directory as your Node.js server file. This is all you need for a SSL connection.
So now you set up a quick hello world example (the biggest difference between https and http is the options parameter)***/
